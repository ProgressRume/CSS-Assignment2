        <h3>Oghenerume Progress</h3>
        <p> It seems like ages ago, but there was a time where it takes days or even months before you can <b>communicate</b>
            with someone in another city or country. This is however, not the case today as <b>technology</b> has helped to
            bridge this gap. <i>With technology, we can now communicate with anyone anywhere.</i>
            It gives us more free time, saves time and money and even helps us make more money while having fun.</p>

        <h3>What I have learned so far</h3>
        <p><i>It has only been a few weeks at Stutern,</i> but I feel I have learnt so much. I have learnt the <b>basics of HTML
            and CSS.</b>
            Specifically in CSS, I am now familiar with <i>Inheritance and Specificity.</i> I have also learnt different ways
            of styling, the concept of the CSS box model.
            Some other concepts I have learnt include how to use properties such as background properties, text
            alignment etc.

        <h3>Difference between paddings, borders and margins</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Padding, Border and Margin</b> are all properties of the CSS box model. Padding refers to the inner space
            between the content and the border of your box.
            Border on the other hand refers to the <i>perimeter of the box.</i> This can be invisible or styled to have a thick
            colored line. Margin is the <i>outer space</i> (or lack of space) surrounding the box.
